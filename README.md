# Hello World!!

I'm Tristen, I'm 19 and I live in Ottawa.

# About Me

I currently attend Carleton University studying Commerce with a minor in Computer Science.
If I could have any Super power it would be teleportation. 
My favourite food is Pizza. 
I don't have a favourite colour, I'm not 7. 
My parents have 4 cats and live near Toronto. 

I've been programming since 16, and in that time have learned some C, Java, Python, HTML and Ruby.
My best of those languages is by far Java.
